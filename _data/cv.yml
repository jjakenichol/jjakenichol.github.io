      year: 2019 - ...
      description:
        # - Participated in the Lab Driven Research & Development project CLDERA, which seeks to develop tools to identify source to impact pathways in climate systems.
        # -	Researched the application of causal discovery, specifically the PC and PCMCI algorithms, for identifying causal pathways from the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption.
        # -	Developed the CaStLe algorithm for constructing spatiotemporal causal graphs of local dependencies in climate data.
        # -	Researched random forest machine learning techniques for learning about emergent dynamics in climate models.
        # -	Used feature importance analysis to make comparisons between observed and simulated data to look for the simulations' faults.
